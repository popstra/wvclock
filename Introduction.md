# Introduction #

This project is intended to be an introduction to Android for non-JAVA developers.  Geared towards developers who are used to create web applications and have skills to create web pages and applications using Javascript, HTML and CSS.

It's an alternative to using PhoneGap.  It's intended as a template for an Android application.

I've included links to all of the packages and sites I've used to create this app.  Also, I've compiled and published the app on android play.
