This is a sample Android application that uses a WebView with HTML/CSS for it's presentation/display.  It's just an example.  It's a collection of various techniques to communicate back-and-forth between the activity and the browser.

The reason why I put this together is because I couldn't find any single location which showed all of this information together.

This is an alternative approach to using PhoneGap.  Use PhoneGap if you want cross-platform compatibility and the additional features offered by PhoneGap.  But, if you just want to target Android, in my opinion, this may be a better approach.  The advantage here is that you can access the native device features directly without having to go through PhoneGap's interface.

So, it's up to you to evaluate what's best for your application.  If you learn a different approach, a new technique or this project makes you think, then, it's served it's purpose.
